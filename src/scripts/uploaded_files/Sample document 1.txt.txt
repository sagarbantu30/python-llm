colonoscopy, with biopsy (PROC) 2023-09-08T00:00:00-05:00
GASTROENTEROLOGIST: Jim Jones, DO ANESTHESIA: Per Anesthesia note. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES AND INDICATIONS: The patient has a history of Crohn disease and recurrent diverticulitis. Repeat surveillance colonoscopy to re-stage his Crohn disease and assess for any active diverticulitis since he now reports some recurrent abdominal pain. Colonoscopy with biopsy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Mildly granular ileocolonic anastomosis. 2. Pandiverticular disease of a moderate distribution of the sigmoid colon with no active diverticulitis. 3. Essentially normal appearing terminal ileum. 4. Essentially normal appearing colonic mucosa. 5. Small internal hemorrhoids. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient is prepared in the usual fashion and brought to the endoscopy suite, where the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Rectal examination was performed, which revealed small hemorrhoids. I then took an Olympus video colonoscope and passed it easily from the rectum up into the cecum. Of note, the ileocecal valve appeared surgically altered. It appeared granular at the level of the anastomosis. I was able to intubate the terminal ileum by multiple centimeters and the mucosa was grossly normal. I took multiple random biopsies of the terminal ileum to screen for microscopic inflammation. There was minimal heme in all biopsy sites. I also then took separate biopsies of the anastomosis, which was mildly granular to assess for active Crohn disease. If there is any active Crohn disease, it was localized to this anastomosis and orifice. The surrounding tissue was otherwise grossly normal. As I slowly removed the colonoscope, I carefully visualized the ascending, transverse, and descending colons in its entirety. The patient had mild diverticular disease of a moderate distribution of the sigmoid colon. There was no evidence of diverticulitis. Multiple biopsies were obtained to screen for microscopic inflammation or Crohn disease. With the naked eye, the tissue was grossly normal. I ultimately retroflexed the tip of the colonoscope in the rectum and other than hemorrhoids, no other pathology was seen. The colonoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. Our plan at present will be to await his biopsies. Antibiotic use is not clinically indicated today. A repeat colonoscopy in 2-3 years will be recommended in surveillance for colorectal cancer in this individual with long-standing Crohn disease.

Hi Mr. Smith, The x-ray of your spine does show evidence of moderate degenerative changes involving your lumbar spine (lower back). Based on these findings it most likely explains the pain you have been experiencing with movement involving your back such as getting out of bed in the morning. I would recommend you follow up with your primary care provider about these findings and determine how to proceed in future with getting you to feel better. You may benefit from having MRI of your lower spine or physical therapy. Sincerely, Nurse Practitioner with GI Department
